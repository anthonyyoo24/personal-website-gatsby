        Hi! I am a self-taught developer from Waterloo, Canada with a passion for problem solving,
        building, and designing. Since the first day I started coding, I was hooked and realized
        this was what I wanted to dedicate my career towards. Learning new technologies is always
        exciting and something I look forward to as I continue to develop my skills. And I am
        excited by the prospect of working on amazing products that will continue to enrich peoplesâ€™
        lives long after they are built. So I would love to bring my passion, drive, and skills to a
        like-minded team where we can help each other grow and make a positive difference in the
        world.
      </p>
