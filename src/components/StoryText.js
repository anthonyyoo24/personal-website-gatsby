        Ever since I was young, I have had lofty ambitions of becoming very
        successful and making a significant impact on the world. Earlier on, it
        was more of a raw, unarticulated sense of desire that had no real
        specificity or direction. But I could always feel it resonating within
        me even during the times I strayed from my path and felt lost. It helped
        guide me through my darkest moments and continues to instill me with a
        sense of purpose everyday. It is the reason I get up every morning and
        keep moving forward despite all the doubts and fears. It is what brought
        me to this point in my life where I feel like I have finally found my
        real calling. It has been quite the journey to get here but let us first
        take a detour to my past.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far back as elementary school, I have always gravitated towards
        strategy games. At first it was Starcraft and Warcraft, but once I
        reached high school, I discovered poker. I instantly fell in love with
        it the first time I played it. It is kind of hard to describe the level
        of excitement and intellectual stimulation that I derived from it
        especially when I first started out. I could not stop thinking about it
        even when I was not playing. It was hard for me to focus during school
        lectures because I would constantly replay hands in my head and analyze
        them. I was able to support a decent amount of my finances throughout
        high school and early university through poker and even took a few
        semesters off to pursue it full time to see if it was a viable career
        option. However, long story short, I eventually realized that poker was
        one of those passions that I enjoyed as a hobby, but not as a full-time
        job.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I decided to go back and finish my Math and Business degree at the
        University of Waterloo and during that time I quickly developed an
        interest in finance. It was a field that poker players commonly
        transitioned to due to our natural obsession with logic, analysis, and
        strategy as well as our ability to handle risk. I took as many finance
        and accounting courses as I could and had my sights set on working in
        Wall Street. I even registered for the CFA exam and ordered all the
        required textbooks.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was also around the time when I started developing a strong
        interest in reading. And as fate would have it, I ended up reading a
        book called “Zero to One” by Peter Thiel. The main theme of it was
        centered around the concept of vertical progress, which means doing
        something that nobody else has ever done (0 to 1) rather than copying
        something that already works (1 to n). The book left a lasting
        impression on me that I could not shake. It forced me to reconcile my
        current career goals with my newfound desire to build lasting products
        that continue to enrich peoples’ lives long after they are built. I
        ended up making a tough decision to quit my pursuit of finance and not
        write the CFA exam which I paid more than a thousand dollars for.

        I felt drawn towards the tech world, but I was a bit uncertain because I
        have never really been a technical person. Since I did not major in
        engineering or computer science and had minimal experience with coding,
        I did not have a clear idea of what type of role I could fill. But I did
        have some close friends who were in engineering so I thought maybe I
        could figure out a way to work with them if I came up with a legitimate
        app idea. So, I tried my best to brainstorm for one, but in the end, I
        could not come up with anything compelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point I just graduated and really wanted a change in my
        environment, so I decided to move to Toronto in the meantime and figure
        things out as I go. I eventually landed a job at a healthcare company as
        an accounts receivable clerk so that I could just pay my bills. However,
        as time went on, I still could not figure out a specific idea of what I
        wanted to do. It was the first time in my life that I genuinely felt
        lost and I subsequently fell into complacency for a while. As I was
        dealing with several other personal issues at the time, I ended up in
        the lowest point of my life where hope and optimism seemed to constantly
        escape me. But what really helped me keep going were the grand and
        arguably delusional aspirations that I have held for most of my life. I
        desperately desired to fulfill the high expectations that I set out to
        achieve ever since I was a kid.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a bit of faith and perseverance, I slowly made my way out of that
        slump and in a well-timed twist of fate, I came across a story of a
        well-known retired online poker player who successfully transitioned to
        a programming career, landing his first job at Airbnb. I was astonished
        because he had hardly any prior coding experience and I had this
        preconceived notion that developer jobs required people who have already
        been coding for many years. This did not seem to be the case at all and
        furthermore, I discovered what a coding bootcamp was. As I started
        looking into it, I found more and more bootcamp success stories of
        people from all walks of life who had no technical background
        whatsoever, from plumbers to models. I also discovered many success
        stories of people who simply taught themselves by taking courses online,
        which I found more appealing given that bootcamps are quite a financial
        commitment. The more I researched the more my optimism grew. I felt like
        I had finally found the answer that I was looking for. From then on, I
        decided that this was the path I was going to pursue.

        Around this time, I had to go into surgery to remove an enlarged thyroid
        cyst that was inhibiting my breathing, so I was able to take a couple
        weeks off work. While I was recovering in the hospital and after I left,
        I went through some online courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During
        this experimental phase, not only did I feel like I had a good grasp on
        everything that was taught, I really enjoyed it. It rekindled my passion
        for problem solving in a way that was reminiscent of my poker playing
        days. Given that I had been unhappy with my current job situation for a
        while and thought about quitting on a regular basis, I finally decided
        to pull the trigger around the end of last year so that I could learn to
        code full-time. I promptly packed up my things and moved back to my
        hometown in Waterloo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since that day until now, it felt like I went through a bit of a
        spiritual journey where I learned a ton about myself and my flaws, as
        well as making significant improvements to my work ethic and ability to
        focus. Learning how to be self-accountable and self-motivated was an
        entirely different animal that I was able to eventually tame with
        persistent effort. I reminded myself that I am capable of learning new
        difficult things if I really set my mind to it. I now feel as confident
        as ever that I have the persistence, intelligence, and resourcefulness
        to tackle everything that I have yet to learn going forward on this
        journey. Although I am now at a point where I feel like I am competent
        enough to enter the job market, I have never felt hungrier to learn as
        much as I possibly can to become the best possible developer I can be. I
        am super excited to see what the next chapter of my life has in store
        for me and am looking forward to working with the right people who have
        a meaningful vision that I can get onboard with.
